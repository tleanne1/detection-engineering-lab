# ⚡ Detection Engineering Lab

Enterprise Detection Engineering Lab focused on developing, tuning, validating, and documenting security detections using Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, KQL, and MITRE ATT&CK.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical detection engineering workflows used to identify malicious activity, reduce false positives, improve alert fidelity, and support threat hunting operations.

The lab focuses on:

- Custom Detection Development
- Detection Tuning
- KQL Analytics
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- Detection Validation
- Threat Hunting Support
- Incident Response Enablement

---

## Technologies

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Azure Log Analytics
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Detection Coverage

| Detection | ATT&CK Technique |
|------------|------------------|
| Encoded PowerShell Execution | T1059.001 |
| Suspicious PowerShell Download | T1059.001 |
| Registry Persistence | T1547.001 |
| Credential Dumping Indicators | T1003 |
| Remote Service Creation | T1021 |
| Lateral Movement Activity | T1021 |
| Suspicious Scheduled Tasks | T1053 |
| Abnormal Authentication Activity | T1078 |

## Detection Lifecycle

1. Threat Research
2. Detection Design
3. KQL Development
4. Testing & Validation
5. False Positive Analysis
6. Tuning
7. Deployment
8. Continuous Improvement
